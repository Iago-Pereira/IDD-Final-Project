# IDD-Final-Project

## Project Description and Initial Plan

### Project Idea and Application

The project consists of a prototype for a wheelchair that can be controlled via electroencephalogram (EEG) sensing. The main application of this wheelchair is to enable paralyzed individuals to have control over their transportation by using their thoughts.

### Expected Parts

EEG headset, arduino, wheels, motors, LEDs, small physical wheelchair prototype.

### Interaction Plan

The person will wear the headset, which will be connected to the wheelchair, and control the wheelchair movement with it.

## Project Implementation 

### Individual Hardware Components

We bought the Star Wars Force Trainer II toy, which contains an EEG sensing headset that uses a NeuroSky board. We also gathered a green LED and a green LED with the corresponding 220 Ohm resistors, and a motor with the corresponding components to build a protective circuit around it: a transistor, a 22 KOhm resistor, and a diode. We used an Arduino Uno to control the different components, and jumper wires to connect them together.
